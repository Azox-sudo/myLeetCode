/*
*so this is how i think about solving this
*tldr the goal is turn numbers into english words
*so i will make a array with 0-19 in english cuz those are unique 
*i will make one for twenty-ninty cuz those kinda unique as well and from this point
*i will do the calc and type hundred thousand these static words milions bilions etc cuz they 
*are always the same
--------------------
Steps
--------------------
1) make variable from 1-19
2) make variable from 20-30-40-....-ninty
3) add hundred thousand etc by calculating
